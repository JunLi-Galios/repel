Probabilistic Event Logic
--------------------------

This is a work in progress.  Expect more details in here soon.

To build
--------
me@myhost:~/git/pel$ mkdir build; cd build
me@myhost:~/git/pel/build$ cmake ../

Eclipse instructions
--------------------
Make a directory adjacent to the pel directory called pel-eclipse or something
similar (ie if pel is in src/pel, then the build directory is
src/pel-eclipse).  Inside that directory, type:

cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -DECLIPSE_CDT4_GENERATE_SOURCE_PROJECT=TRUE ../pel

Then once that's done, import the directory into eclipse.
