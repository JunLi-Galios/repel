# test formulas file
#
# format is: "weight: formula". 
# Symbols:
#   Atom: pred(constant, ..., constant)
#     currently variables are not working (neither are types)
#   Negation: ! or ~
#   Disjunction: v or |
#   Implication: -> or =>
#   LiquidOp: [ <subformula ]
#   Conjunction: ^{<relations>} or &{relations}
#     with no relation given, defaults to = relation
#     ";" is an alias for ^{m}
#     multiple relations are separated by commas, ie P(x) ^{m,mi} Q(x)
#   Diamond: <>{<relations>} <atom>
#     note that diamondop has pretty high precedence so you may need ()s
#     relations are specified as before
#
